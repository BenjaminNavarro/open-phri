Disclamer
=========

OpenPHRI has been through a lot of changes recently so the Python bindings are not up to date and can't be used at the moment.

Also, the documentation is currently being written and can be found on [GitBook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core). 

Once the documentation is finished and the Python bindings are updated, the V1.0.0 will be released. In the meantime, don't easitate to create an issue if something requires a fix or some explanations or if you find that something is missing from the library.

Overview
=========

For an overview of the library, you can check the related [Robotics and Automation Magazine article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/100/4600619/08360398.pdf), but keep in mind that the library went through some changes since its writing and so some parts might not be up-to-date.

You can find the documentation (work in progress) about OpenPHRI in this [Gitbook](https://openphri.gitbook.io/core).

DISCLAMER: version 1.0, the current release, has lots of improvements compared to initial release (0.x), but the Python bindings haven't been updated and so cannot be used. Since a version 2.0 with major usability improvements is on its way, the 1.0 will not be updated except for potential bugs fixes. Python bindings will be back with 2.0.
